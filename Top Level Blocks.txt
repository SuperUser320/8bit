### Top Level Blocks
1. __Program Counter__
	* A counter that will increment with every operation done
2. __Registers__
	* Memory which will temporarily store bits for an operation to use
	* Two will be required, one for the parameter, and one to store the value being operated on
	* One will be required to store memory addresses (MAR)
3. __Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)__
	* The device which interprets the arithmetic instruction and performs it on the given registers
	* Two instructions, add (ADD) and subtract (SUB) are required of this device
4. __Program Memory/RAM__
	* 256 Bytes of RAM accessed by 8 bit locations
5. __Instruction Register__
	* 4 bit register to store the operation
6. __Output Register__
	* 8 bit register that will display an 8 bit number
7. __Synchronous Clock__
	* Simple 555 timer (around 1Hz for testing)
8.  __Sequencer/Controller__
	* A ring counter which tells each register/instruction when to operate
